    <h2>How Collibra Data Quality and Observability Enhance the Governance Catalog</h2>

    <p>Collibra Data Quality and Observability work together to enhance the <strong>Collibra Data Governance Catalog</strong> by providing more in-depth insights into data health and improving overall data governance processes. Here's how they complement and improve the governance catalog:</p>

    <h3>1. Enriched Data Governance with Quality Metrics</h3>
    <p><strong>Data Quality</strong> ensures that the data stored in the <strong>Governance Catalog</strong> is reliable and meets predefined standards for accuracy, completeness, and consistency. By integrating quality metrics directly into the catalog, users can assess the quality of the data they’re working with at a glance. This builds trust in the data, as users know it adheres to business rules and standards.</p>

    <h3>2. Proactive Data Monitoring</h3>
    <p><strong>Observability</strong> introduces real-time monitoring and visibility into the data pipelines and systems that feed into the governance catalog. It detects and surfaces anomalies, errors, and performance issues as they happen, helping to quickly address issues before they degrade data quality or impact decision-making processes.</p>

    <h3>3. Improved Data Stewardship</h3>
    <p>With both <strong>Data Quality</strong> and <strong>Observability</strong>, data stewards and owners gain actionable insights into the health of the data. They can prioritize and resolve issues more effectively, improving both the governance of data and the overall user experience. Issues like broken data pipelines or failed quality checks are easily flagged, and remediation processes are streamlined.</p>

    <h1>Apache NiFi Overview</h1>
    <p>Apache NiFi is an open-source data integration tool designed to automate the flow of data between systems. It provides a user-friendly web-based interface that allows users to design, monitor, and control data flows through a visual programming approach. NiFi is particularly useful for organizations that need to move large volumes of data from diverse sources to various destinations in a scalable, reliable, and efficient manner.</p>
    
    <h2>Key Features of Apache NiFi:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><h3>Data Flow Automation:</h3> NiFi automates the transfer of data between systems, handling tasks such as data ingestion, routing, transformation, and delivery.</li>
        <li><h3>Visual Interface:</h3> It offers a drag-and-drop interface for designing data flows, making it accessible for both technical and non-technical users.</li>
        <li><h3>Scalability:</h3> NiFi can scale horizontally, allowing it to handle large data volumes and high-throughput scenarios.</li>
        <li><h3>Flexibility:</h3> It supports a wide range of data formats and protocols, including JSON, XML, CSV, HTTP, FTP, Kafka, and more.</li>
        <li><h3>Data Provenance:</h3> NiFi tracks the lineage of data as it moves through the system, providing detailed logs and audit trails that can be used for monitoring and debugging.</li>
        <li><h3>Security:</h3> It includes features like SSL encryption, multi-tenant authorization, and secure authentication mechanisms to ensure data privacy and compliance.</li>
        <li><h3>Extensibility:</h3> NiFi is highly extensible, allowing developers to create custom processors and integrate with various external systems through APIs and other plugins.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Common Use Cases:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><h3>Data Ingestion:</h3> NiFi is often used to ingest data from various sources, such as databases, APIs, IoT devices, and cloud services, into data lakes or data warehouses.</li>
        <li><h3>Data Transformation:</h3> It can perform complex data transformations, such as filtering, enrichment, aggregation, and formatting, as data moves through the flow.</li>
        <li><h3>Real-Time Data Processing:</h3> NiFi is suitable for processing and analyzing data in real-time, making it valuable in use cases like fraud detection, log monitoring, and IoT data analysis.</li>
        <li><h3>Data Integration:</h3> Organizations use NiFi to integrate data across different systems, ensuring seamless data flow between on-premises and cloud environments.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>NiFi is widely adopted in industries like finance, healthcare, telecommunications, and government for its ability to manage data pipelines efficiently and securely.</p>

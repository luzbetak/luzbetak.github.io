    <h1>Apache Parquet Format</h1>

    <p><strong>Apache Parquet</strong> is a columnar storage file format optimized for use with data processing systems like Apache Hadoop, Apache Spark, and cloud-based data lakes. It is highly efficient for large-scale data storage and retrieval, especially for analytic workloads.</p>

    <h2>Key Features of Parquet:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Columnar Storage:</strong> Parquet stores data in a columnar format, which makes it ideal for analytical queries that only need to access specific columns of data. This reduces I/O by minimizing the amount of data read.</li>
        <li><strong>Efficient Compression:</strong> Parquet applies compression techniques like dictionary encoding, run-length encoding (RLE), and bit-packing to compress data efficiently, leading to lower storage costs and faster query performance.</li>
        <li><strong>Schema Evolution:</strong> Parquet supports schema evolution, allowing changes to the schema of the data over time, such as adding new columns, without breaking compatibility with existing data.</li>
        <li><strong>Optimized for Analytics:</strong> The columnar format makes it well-suited for OLAP workloads and big data analytics, where aggregating, filtering, and selecting specific columns of data are common operations.</li>
        <li><strong>Interoperability:</strong> Parquet is supported by many big data processing engines such as Apache Hive, Apache Impala, Apache Spark, and cloud services like AWS Redshift, Azure Synapse, and Google BigQuery.</li>
        <li><strong>Splitting and Parallelism:</strong> Parquet files can be split into multiple parts, allowing large files to be processed in parallel across a distributed system for improved performance.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Benefits of Using Parquet:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Reduced Storage Costs:</strong> Parquet's efficient compression reduces the size of stored data, cutting down on storage expenses.</li>
        <li><strong>Faster Query Performance:</strong> Columnar storage and compression allow queries to run faster by reading only the necessary columns of data.</li>
        <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> Parquet files are designed to scale easily in distributed environments, making them a go-to format for large-scale data processing systems.</li>
        <li><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Parquet's wide support across multiple platforms and data processing frameworks ensures easy integration into modern data architectures.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Use Cases:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Big data analytics on massive datasets that require efficient storage and fast query performance.</li>
        <li>Data warehousing environments that need optimized storage and access for analytical queries.</li>
        <li>ETL pipelines where data is ingested, transformed, and processed across distributed systems.</li>
    </ul>

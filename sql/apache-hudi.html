    <h1>Apache Hudi</h1>
    <p><strong>Apache Hudi (Hadoop Upserts Deletes and Incrementals)</strong> is an open-source data management framework that simplifies large-scale data ingestion and provides ACID transaction support on data lakes. Itâ€™s designed for scenarios that require efficient data upserts (updates and inserts) and deletes in big data environments, while also enabling near real-time ingestion and querying of data.</p>
    
    <h2>Key Features of Apache Hudi:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>ACID Transactions:</strong> Hudi brings ACID transactions to data lakes, allowing users to perform updates, inserts, and deletes with transactional guarantees on large datasets.</li>
        <li><strong>Efficient Storage:</strong> Hudi optimizes storage by managing file sizes and using efficient compression techniques, reducing the overall storage footprint while maintaining performance.</li>
        <li><strong>Near Real-Time Data Processing:</strong> With Hudi, you can perform incremental data ingestion, which ensures that only changed data is processed, reducing the latency in making fresh data available for analytics.</li>
        <li><strong>Indexing and Compaction:</strong> Hudi maintains indexes on data to accelerate query performance and also supports background compaction to clean up older versions of data, improving performance over time.</li>
        <li><strong>Time Travel Queries:</strong> Hudi allows users to perform queries on historical data by maintaining versions of data, enabling "time travel" queries to access previous versions of datasets.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Use Cases:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Data lakes that require efficient upserts and deletes at scale.</li>
        <li>Building near real-time data pipelines with low latency.</li>
        <li>Historical data querying and analytics with time-travel capabilities.</li>
        <li>Optimizing large-scale data lakes for cost-effective storage and performance.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion:</h2>
    <p>Apache Hudi is ideal for environments where frequent updates, incremental processing, and ACID guarantees are necessary on top of a scalable data lake. It bridges the gap between traditional batch processing systems and real-time analytics by enabling near real-time ingestion and querying, making it a powerful tool for modern data architectures.</p>

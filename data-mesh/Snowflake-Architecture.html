    <h2>Inmon (Top-Down):</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Centralized, normalized enterprise data warehouse design for scalable and flexible data integration.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Kimball (Bottom-Up):</h2>

  <h2>Snowflake Data Warehouse Architecture</h2>
  <p>Snowflake is a cloud-based data warehousing platform that enables the storage, processing, and analysis of large volumes of data. It handles both structured and semi-structured data and is optimized for modern cloud environments.</p>

  <h3>Snowflake Architecture</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Cloud-Native:</strong> Built for the cloud, using providers like AWS, Azure, and GCP. It scales automatically based on workloads, unlike traditional on-premise databases.</li>
    <li><strong>Decoupled Storage and Compute:</strong> 
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Storage Layer:</strong> Stores data in an optimized, compressed format in cloud storage. Supports both structured and semi-structured data (JSON, Parquet, Avro).</li>
        <li><strong>Compute Layer:</strong> Uses virtual warehouses (clusters of compute resources) for query processing. These virtual warehouses work independently on the same data.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Elasticity and Scalability:</strong> Supports auto-scaling of compute resources, ensuring cost-efficiency and flexible scaling.</li>
    <li><strong>Zero-Copy Cloning:</strong> Allows for instant, space-efficient cloning of databases, schemas, or tables without duplicating data.</li>
    <li><strong>Time Travel and Data Retention:</strong> Keeps historical data for up to 90 days, allowing recovery and auditing.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Data Warehouse Architectures</h3>

  <h4>Inmon's Top-Down Approach</h4>
  <p>Inmon’s architecture focuses on building a <strong>centralized enterprise data warehouse (EDW)</strong> using a <strong>normalized</strong> structure for flexibility and scalability.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Data is integrated from various sources into the EDW.</li>
    <li>Data marts are created from the EDW for reporting and analysis.</li>
    <li>Ideal for large-scale integration and ensures data consistency across the organization.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Kimball's Bottom-Up Approach</h4>
  <p>Kimball’s approach starts by building <strong>data marts</strong> for individual departments using a <strong>denormalized</strong> structure optimized for fast queries.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Data marts are later integrated to form a data warehouse.</li>
    <li>Uses <strong>dimensional modeling</strong> (e.g., star schemas and snowflake schemas) to organize data for fast querying.</li>
    <li>Focuses on quick wins and performance, though scaling may be more challenging for large organizations.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Snowflake in Context of Inmon and Kimball</h3>
  <p>Snowflake supports both architectures depending on how you structure your data:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>For <strong>Inmon’s Top-Down</strong> approach, Snowflake allows you to design a centralized, normalized data warehouse with high scalability.</li>
    <li>For <strong>Kimball’s Bottom-Up</strong> approach, Snowflake’s performance optimizations make it an excellent platform for fast querying on denormalized data marts.</li>
  </ul>

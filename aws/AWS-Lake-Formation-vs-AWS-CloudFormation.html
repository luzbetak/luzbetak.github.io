    <h2>1. Purpose:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>AWS Lake Formation:</strong> Focuses on building and managing secure data lakes. Simplifies the process of ingesting, organizing, securing, and cataloging large amounts of data from multiple sources.</li>
        <li><strong>AWS CloudFormation:</strong> Focuses on automating the deployment and management of AWS infrastructure resources through templates for consistent and repeatable provisioning.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Functionality:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>AWS Lake Formation:</strong> Builds, cleans, and secures data lakes. Provides fine-grained access control and integrates with AWS Glue, S3, Athena, Redshift, and EMR for data management.</li>
        <li><strong>AWS CloudFormation:</strong> Manages AWS infrastructure through JSON or YAML templates. Automates the provisioning and updating of AWS services.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Main Use Cases:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>AWS Lake Formation:</strong> Setting up and managing data lakes on AWS, centralizing data for analysis, and enforcing secure access control over data.</li>
        <li><strong>AWS CloudFormation:</strong> Automating infrastructure deployment, version-controlling infrastructure as code, and managing the lifecycle of AWS services.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Security and Access:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>AWS Lake Formation:</strong> Provides fine-grained data access controls at the table, column, or row level, securing sensitive or regulated data.</li>
        <li><strong>AWS CloudFormation:</strong> Manages AWS services with IAM role permissions, focusing on infrastructure resource provisioning.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Integrations:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>AWS Lake Formation:</strong> Integrates with data services like Amazon S3, AWS Glue, Amazon Athena, Redshift, and EMR for analytics and data management.</li>
        <li><strong>AWS CloudFormation:</strong> Integrates with various AWS services like EC2, S3, VPC, RDS, Lambda, and IAM for automated resource deployment.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Granularity:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>AWS Lake Formation:</strong> Provides data-level management, including control over data storage, permissions, and security policies.</li>
        <li><strong>AWS CloudFormation:</strong> Provides infrastructure-level management, allowing full control over AWS resources in a cloud environment.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Management Scope:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>AWS Lake Formation:</strong> Focuses on data management and governance, managing metadata, permissions, and data cataloging.</li>
        <li><strong>AWS CloudFormation:</strong> Focuses on automating infrastructure provisioning and management using code templates.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Both services are important but serve different purposes: <strong>Lake Formation</strong> manages and secures your data, while <strong>CloudFormation</strong> automates the setup and configuration of cloud infrastructure.</p>

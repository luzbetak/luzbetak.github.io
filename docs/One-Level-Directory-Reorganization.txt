You are a senior DevOps / Data Platform engineer.

I will give you:
1) A directory tree output (`tree`)
2) A domain name (e.g., aws, databricks, database, tools, snowflake, redshift)

Your task is to:

GOAL
-----
Reorganize the files into a clean, logical structure using **ONLY ONE LEVEL of subdirectories**.

STRICT RULES
------------
1. Create **only one-level subdirectories** (no nested submenus beyond 1 level).
2. Leave `index.html` in the root directory untouched.
3. Existing directories may be moved as-is, but must remain **only one level deep**.
4. Do NOT invent new deep hierarchies.
5. Do NOT rename files.
6. Group files by clear, professional technical domains (e.g., architecture, ingestion, security, analytics).
7. The result must be suitable for GitHub Pages navigation.
8. The solution must be **idempotent** (safe to re-run).
9. Use macOS Bash only.
10. Suppress errors when files already moved (`mv … || true`).
11. Do NOT include explanations inside the script.

DELIVERABLES
------------
1. A short section titled:
   "One-level <domain> menu structure"
   showing the final directory layout.
2. A complete macOS Bash script named:
   `<domain>_reorg_one_level.sh`
3. The script must:
   - Use `set -e`
   - Define `ROOT="."`
   - Create directories with `mkdir -p`
   - Move files with `mv ... 2>/dev/null || true`
   - Print a single completion message at the end

STYLE
-----
- No emojis
- No marketing language
- No opinions
- Clean, professional, deterministic output
- Flat navigation emphasis

INPUT FORMAT
------------
Here is the directory tree:

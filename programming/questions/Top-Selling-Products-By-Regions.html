<h2>Python Script to Find Top-selling Products in Each Region (2023)</h2>

<p>This Python script utilizes the <code>sqlite3</code> library to create a SQLite database, store sales data, and query the database to find the top-selling products in each region for the year 2023 based on total sales revenue.</p>

<h3>Script Description:</h3>

<ul>
    <li>The script creates a SQLite database and a table called <code>sales</code> with sample data.</li>
    <li>It calculates the total sales revenue by multiplying the <code>quantity</code> sold and the <code>price</code> of the product for the year 2023.</li>
    <li>A ranking query is executed to find the top-selling product (highest sales revenue) in each region.</li>
    <li>The result is displayed, showing the <code>region_id</code>, <code>product_id</code>, and <code>total_sales_revenue</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Python Code:</h3>

<h3>Explanation:</h3>
<p>The script begins by creating a connection to a SQLite database. If the database does not exist, it creates one named <code>sales_data.db</code>. After connecting to the database, the <code>sales</code> table is created with the specified columns: <code>transaction_id</code>, <code>product_id</code>, <code>region_id</code>, <code>sale_date</code>, <code>quantity</code>, and <code>price</code>. The sample data is then inserted into the table.</p>

<p>Once the data is inserted, the script runs an SQL query to calculate the total sales revenue for each product in each region for the year 2023. It uses a window function <code>RANK()</code> to rank the products by their total sales revenue within each region. The script then selects the product with the highest sales revenue in each region and displays the result.</p>

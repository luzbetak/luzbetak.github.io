<h1>New Project Design</h1>

<h2>1. Define Objectives and Scope</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Objective:</strong> Identify the project's primary goal, such as solving a specific problem or building a new feature.</li>
  <li><strong>Scope:</strong> Clearly define the boundaries, including what is in and out of scope, specific deliverables, and key success metrics.</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. Research and Requirements Gathering</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Stakeholder Interviews:</strong> Understand needs and expectations.</li>
  <li><strong>Competitive Analysis:</strong> Review similar projects to gather ideas and best practices.</li>
  <li><strong>Technical Requirements:</strong> Determine tools, technologies, integrations, and compliance needs.</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Architectural Design and Technology Stack</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Choose Architecture:</strong> Decide on an architecture type (e.g., microservices, serverless) based on project needs.</li>
  <li><strong>Select Technologies:</strong> Pick languages, frameworks, databases, and cloud services to support objectives.</li>
  <li><strong>Scalability and Security:</strong> Plan for growth and security requirements.</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. Design the Solution</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>System Diagram:</strong> Create a high-level diagram showing components and interactions.</li>
  <li><strong>Data Flow:</strong> Map data flow across the system, focusing on inputs and outputs.</li>
  <li><strong>User Interface (UI):</strong> Sketch or wireframe main screens and navigation.</li>
</ul>

<h2>5. Project Planning and Timeline</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Task Breakdown:</strong> Break down the project into smaller tasks or sprints.</li>
  <li><strong>Set Milestones:</strong> Establish milestones for progress tracking.</li>
  <li><strong>Assign Roles:</strong> Allocate resources and responsibilities for each task.</li>
</ul>

<h2>6. Development and Testing</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Develop:</strong> Follow agile or waterfall methodologies, iterating tasks and gathering feedback.</li>
  <li><strong>Testing:</strong> Conduct functionality, performance, and security tests (unit, integration, end-to-end).</li>
</ul>

<h2>7. Deployment and Monitoring</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Deployment:</strong> Deploy in staging for final testing, then push to production.</li>
  <li><strong>Monitoring and Optimization:</strong> Set up performance monitoring and error tracking, adjusting post-launch as needed.</li>
</ul>

<h2>8. Documentation and Handoff</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Document:</strong> Prepare documentation covering architecture, codebase, usage, and troubleshooting.</li>
  <li><strong>Training and Handoff:</strong> Train team or users, ensuring a smooth handoff to operations or maintenance teams.</li>
</ul>

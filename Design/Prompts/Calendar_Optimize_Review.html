    <h1>Help me plan and optimize my week.</h1>

    <h2>Phase 1: Calendar Review</h2>
    <p>Review my calendar and show me a summary:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Total meetings</li>
        <li>Busiest days</li>
        <li>Where I have gaps of 2+ hours</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Phase 2: Clarifying Questions</h2>
    <p>Before proposing changes, ask me about:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>What I'm trying to accomplish this week</li>
        <li>How much focus time I need and for what</li>
        <li>Any deadlines or commitments not on my calendar</li>
        <li>Which types of meetings I should decline or shorten</li>
        <li>Personal commitments or boundaries I want to protect</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Phase 3: Optimization Proposals</h2>
    <p>Then show me your top <strong>3–5 proposed changes</strong> with explanations:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Focus blocks to add</li>
        <li>Meetings to decline or reschedule</li>
        <li>Time conflicts to resolve</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Prioritization Strategy</h3>
    <p>Start with the <strong>highest-impact changes first</strong>. For each proposal, include:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>What change you're recommending</li>
        <li>Why it will improve your week</li>
        <li>Specific actions needed to implement it</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Phase 4: Implementation</h2>
    <p>Once I approve each change, make the edits directly in my calendar <strong>one at a time</strong>.</p>

    <h3>Key Process Notes</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Do not make any calendar changes until I explicitly approve them</li>
        <li>Present all proposed changes before making edits</li>
        <li>Execute approved changes sequentially, confirming each one</li>
        <li>Surface any conflicts or concerns that arise during implementation</li>
    </ul>

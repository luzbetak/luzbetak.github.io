    <h1>How to Install GeForce RTX 3060 on Ubuntu for Machine Learning</h1>
    
    <h2>Step 1: Prepare Your System</h2>
    <p>Before installing the NVIDIA drivers, update your system and install the necessary packages.</p>
    <pre><code class="language-bash">sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade</code></pre>
    <p>Install required build tools and headers:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-bash">sudo apt install build-essential linux-headers-$(uname -r)</code></pre>

    <h2>Step 2: Install NVIDIA Drivers</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Add the NVIDIA PPA:</strong>
            <p>Add the official NVIDIA PPA to get the latest drivers:</p>
            <pre><code class="language-bash">sudo add-apt-repository ppa:graphics-drivers/ppa
sudo apt update</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Identify the Recommended Driver:</strong>
            <p>Find the recommended driver for your GPU using the following command:</p>
            <pre><code class="language-bash">ubuntu-drivers devices</code></pre>
            <p>The output will suggest the best driver for your system. For example, it may recommend <code>nvidia-driver-560</code>.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Install the Recommended Driver:</strong>
            <p>Replace <code>nvidia-driver-xxx</code> with the recommended driver, such as <code>nvidia-driver-560</code>:</p>
            <pre><code class="language-bash">sudo apt install nvidia-driver-560</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Reboot Your System:</strong>
            <p>Reboot your machine to apply the changes:</p>
            <pre><code class="language-bash">sudo reboot</code></pre>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Step 3: Install CUDA (Optional)</h2>
    <p>If you plan to use CUDA for GPU computing, you can install it using the following command:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-bash">sudo apt install nvidia-cuda-toolkit</code></pre>

    <h2>Step 4: Verify Installation</h2>
    <p>After rebooting, you can check if the driver is installed and working properly by running:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-bash">nvidia-smi</code></pre>
    <p>This will display details about your installed GPU and the driver version.</p>

    <h2>What "Non-Free" Means</h2>
    <p>In Ubuntu, the term <strong>non-free</strong> refers to software that is not released under an open-source or free software license. These packages often have restrictions on how the code can be used, modified, or redistributed.</p>
    <p>In the context of <strong>NVIDIA drivers</strong>, <strong>non-free</strong> means that the drivers are proprietary, developed by NVIDIA, and the source code is not available to the public. They are provided as binary-only software, which means you can use the drivers, but you can't modify them or see the underlying source code.</p>
    <p>This is in contrast to the <strong>nouveau</strong> driver, which is a free and open-source implementation for NVIDIA cards but typically offers less performance and fewer features than the proprietary (non-free) NVIDIA drivers.</p>

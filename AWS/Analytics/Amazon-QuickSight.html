    <h2>Sample Amazon QuickSight Analysis Creation</h2>
    <pre><code class="language-yaml">
# Sample configuration for a simple analysis in QuickSight
AnalysisName: "Sales Performance Analysis"
DataSource: "Redshift"
DataSet:
  Name: "Sales Data"
  DataSourceType: "SPICE"
  Columns:
    - Name: "Date"
      Type: "Date"
    - Name: "Product"
      Type: "String"
    - Name: "Sales"
      Type: "Decimal"

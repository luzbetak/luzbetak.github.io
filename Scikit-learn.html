    <h2>Scikit-learn Overview</h2>
    <p>Scikit-learn is a widely used open-source Python library for machine learning, providing simple and efficient tools for data analysis and modeling. It is built on top of popular libraries like <strong>NumPy</strong>, <strong>SciPy</strong>, and <strong>Matplotlib</strong>, and offers a wide range of algorithms for supervised and unsupervised learning.</p>
    
    <h3>Key Features</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Preprocessing:</strong> Tools for scaling, normalization, encoding categorical variables, and handling missing data.</li>
        <li><strong>Model Selection:</strong> Cross-validation, grid search, and hyperparameter tuning for selecting the best models.</li>
        <li><strong>Supervised Learning:</strong> Algorithms like linear regression, support vector machines (SVM), decision trees, and random forests.</li>
        <li><strong>Unsupervised Learning:</strong> Algorithms for clustering (K-means, DBSCAN) and dimensionality reduction (PCA, t-SNE).</li>
        <li><strong>Metrics:</strong> A variety of metrics for evaluating model performance, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC-ROC.</li>
        <li><strong>Model Persistence:</strong> Allows saving trained models for later use via joblib or pickle.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Scikit-learn is highly accessible for both beginners and professionals, with well-documented APIs and good integration with other data science tools like Pandas.</p>

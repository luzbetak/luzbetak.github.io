    <h2>Scikit-learn Overview</h2>
    <p>Scikit-learn is a widely used open-source Python library for machine learning, providing simple and efficient tools for data analysis and modeling. It is built on top of popular libraries like <strong>NumPy</strong>, <strong>SciPy</strong>, and <strong>Matplotlib</strong>, and offers a wide range of algorithms for supervised and unsupervised learning.</p>
    
    <h3>Key Features</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Preprocessing:</strong> Tools for scaling, normalization, encoding categorical variables, and handling missing data.</li>
        <li><strong>Model Selection:</strong> Cross-validation, grid search, and hyperparameter tuning for selecting the best models.</li>
        <li><strong>Supervised Learning:</strong> Algorithms like linear regression, support vector machines (SVM), decision trees, and random forests.</li>
        <li><strong>Unsupervised Learning:</strong> Algorithms for clustering (K-means, DBSCAN) and dimensionality reduction (PCA, t-SNE).</li>
        <li><strong>Metrics:</strong> A variety of metrics for evaluating model performance, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC-ROC.</li>
        <li><strong>Model Persistence:</strong> Allows saving trained models for later use via joblib or pickle.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Scikit-learn is highly accessible for both beginners and professionals, with well-documented APIs and good integration with other data science tools like Pandas.</p>

    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>This code performs the following actions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Loads the Iris dataset.</li>
        <li>Splits the dataset into training and test sets.</li>
        <li>Initializes and trains a Random Forest classifier.</li>
        <li>Predicts on the test set and calculates the accuracy of the model.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>About the Iris Dataset</h3>
    <p>The code will automatically load the Iris dataset using the <code>load_iris()</code> function provided by Scikit-learn. The Iris dataset is one of several built-in toy datasets included in Scikit-learn, so you don't need to manually download or load any external files.</p>

    <h3>Overview of How it Works</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><code>load_iris()</code> fetches the Iris dataset, which contains data on 150 samples of iris flowers, with features like sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.</li>
        <li>The dataset is structured in a <code>Bunch</code> object, which behaves like a dictionary and holds both the data (features) and the target (labels).</li>
        <li>You can directly access the data and labels using <code>data.data</code> for the features and <code>data.target</code> for the labels.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>No external setup is needed to use this datasetâ€”it's available right out of the box in Scikit-learn.</p>

    <h1>Apache Airflow</h1>
    <p>Apache Airflow is an open-source platform used to programmatically author, schedule, and monitor workflows. It allows you to define your workflows as Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) using Python, where each node in the graph represents a task.</p>
    <h2>Key Features</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><h3>Dynamic Pipelines</h3> -  Workflows are defined as code, enabling dynamic pipeline generation.</li>
        <li><h3>Scalability</h3> -  Airflow can scale to support complex workflows across a large number of tasks and workers.</li>
        <li><h3>Extensibility</h3> -  It has a modular architecture with a rich set of plugins and operators that allow integration with various technologies and services, such as databases, cloud services, and more.</li>
        <li><h3>Scheduling</h3> -  Airflow allows you to schedule workflows to run at specified intervals or based on triggers.</li>
        <li><h3>Monitoring</h3> -  Airflow provides a web-based user interface to monitor and manage workflows, including tracking the progress of each task and managing errors.</li>
        <li><h3>Alerting</h3> -  It can send notifications when tasks succeed, fail, or retry, making it easier to manage workflows.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Airflow is widely used in data engineering, data science, and DevOps to automate data pipelines, orchestrate ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes, and manage machine learning workflows.</p>

    <h1>Apache Airflow Key Points</h1>
    <ul>
        <li><p><h3>DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph)</h3> - Workflows are represented as DAGs, which define the order of tasks and their relationships.</li>
        <li><p><h3>Tasks</h3> - Each step in the workflow is a task, which can be executed independently and is defined using Python code.</li>
        <li><p><h3>Operators</h3> - Airflow provides various operators to perform different types of tasks, such as BashOperator, PythonOperator, and SQL operators.</li>
        <li><p><h3>Scheduling</h3> - Airflow allows you to schedule workflows to run at specific intervals or based on external triggers.</li>
        <li><p><h3>Task Dependencies</h3> - You can define dependencies between tasks, ensuring that they execute in the correct order.</li>
        <li><p><h3>Extensibility</h3> - Airflow is highly extensible, allowing custom operators, sensors, and hooks to be created for specific needs.</li>
        <li><p><h3>Web UI</h3> - Airflow has a web-based user interface for monitoring, managing, and troubleshooting workflows.</li>
        <li><p><h3>Scalability</h3> - It supports scaling horizontally across multiple workers and can be integrated with distributed systems like Celery and Kubernetes.</li>
        <li><p><h3>Retry Mechanism</h3> - Airflow provides mechanisms to retry tasks on failure, with configurable delays and limits.</li>
        <li><p><h3>XComs</h3> - Tasks can exchange small amounts of data using XComs, allowing communication between tasks within a DAG.</li>
        <li><p><h3>Versioning</h3> - Airflow supports DAG versioning, making it easier to manage changes and updates to workflows.</li>
        <li><p><h3>Logging</h3> - Airflow logs task execution details, which can be accessed through the web UI for debugging and analysis.</li>
        <li><p><h3>Integrations</h3> - Airflow integrates with various databases, cloud platforms, and services, allowing seamless connection and data flow across systems.</li>
    </ul>

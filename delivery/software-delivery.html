    <h1>Software Delivery</h1>
    <p>Software delivery refers to the process of developing, testing, and deploying software applications to end-users or production environments. It encompasses the entire lifecycle, from initial development and coding through quality assurance, staging, and finally, deployment. Key aspects include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Development:</strong> Writing and building the software code.</li>
        <li><strong>Testing:</strong> Ensuring the software functions as intended, including unit, integration, and performance testing.</li>
        <li><strong>Deployment:</strong> Moving the software to production, making it available to users.</li>
        <li><strong>Monitoring:</strong> Observing the software in the production environment to ensure it operates correctly and efficiently.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Modern practices like Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) automate much of this process, enabling frequent and reliable updates.</p>

    <h1>Popular Software Delivery Tools</h1>
    <p>The most popular software delivery tools often fall into various categories such as Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD), version control, containerization, and configuration management. Here are some of the top tools widely used in the industry:</p>

    <h3>1. CI/CD Tools</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Jenkins:</strong> An open-source automation server that supports building, deploying, and automating projects.</li>
        <li><strong>GitLab CI/CD:</strong> Integrated with GitLab, offering CI/CD pipelines, version control, and issue tracking.</li>
        <li><strong>CircleCI:</strong> A CI/CD platform that automates the software development process.</li>
        <li><strong>Travis CI:</strong> A hosted CI/CD service integrated with GitHub.</li>
        <li><strong>GitHub Actions:</strong> Provides CI/CD functionality directly within GitHub repositories.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. Version Control</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Git:</strong> A distributed version control system, often paired with platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.</li>
        <li><strong>Subversion (SVN):</strong> A centralized version control system, still in use for some legacy projects.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Containerization</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Docker:</strong> A platform for developing, shipping, and running applications inside containers.</li>
        <li><strong>Kubernetes:</strong> An orchestration tool for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4. Configuration Management</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Ansible:</strong> An open-source automation tool for IT tasks like configuration management, application deployment, and task automation.</li>
        <li><strong>Puppet:</strong> A configuration management tool that automates the management of infrastructure.</li>
        <li><strong>Chef:</strong> Another configuration management tool, using recipes to define how infrastructure should be managed.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>5. Monitoring and Logging</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Prometheus:</strong> A monitoring tool designed for reliability and scalability.</li>
        <li><strong>ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana):</strong> A popular stack for centralized logging and searching through logs.</li>
        <li><strong>Grafana:</strong> A monitoring tool that integrates with Prometheus and other data sources to visualize metrics.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>6. Artifact Repositories</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Nexus:</strong> A repository manager that stores, retrieves, and manages binaries and build artifacts.</li>
        <li><strong>Artifactory:</strong> A universal artifact repository manager that supports different package formats.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>7. Infrastructure as Code</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Terraform:</strong> An open-source tool for defining and provisioning infrastructure as code across multiple cloud providers.</li>
        <li><strong>AWS CloudFormation:</strong> An AWS service for provisioning infrastructure using code.</li>
    </ul>
